# Purpose
I started writing this blog as a memo for my coding interview preparation process.
At the mean while, I hope readers can find useful contents in this blog, either
you are preparing for coding interview the same as me, or just hoping to sharp your
data structures and algorithms.
# Approaches
* I will use [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) as my main source of coding questions and answering templates.
* I will try to complete selected questions by tags in Leetcode. For each question,
they will be approached in a various aspects:
  * Problem set
  * Problem set analysis
  * Thinking process
  * Brutal force / First solution
  * Improvements
  * Answer analysis: time/space complexities
  * Take aways: conclusions, templates, programming related takeaways such as the
  usage of a given data structure.
* I will draw a knowledge graph that can represent the structure of all the
problems and their underlying data structure and algorithms that we have processed
so that readers can get a general idea of the big picture of data structures and algorithms.

# Pre-requisites
* **Basic knowledge of Python.** We will use Python3 and I will also try to cover some
basic programming knowledge about Python
* **Leetcode access.** You can register it for free.
* **Basic knowledge of data structures** like array, strings, hashmap and etc. I won't
assume any advanced knowledge of complicated data structure such as tree and graph.
Knowledge of algorithms are not required as learning them together is the main purpose
of this blog.

# Discussion
As I will try my best effort to make my post as accurate as possible, I would also
appreciate your feedback for any questions and improvements. You can use the discussion
section under each question to interact with me and other readers.

# Q&A
* When will I update the blog?
  * I will try to update it on a daily basis but there will for sure be gaps.
* What's your practicing order for Leetcode tags?
  * I will post another follow up blog to talk about my plans for practicing with
  Leetcode.
* Will system designs be discussed?
  * Yes but it will come after the data structure and algorithms.
