***We will follow the following order when we practice with Leetcode***

* Arrays
* Strings
* Hash table
* Stack
* Queue
* Linked list
* Tree
* Graph
* Math
* Bit manipulation
* Recursion
* Sort
* Heap
* Divide and conquer
* Binary Search
* BFS
* DFS
* Union find
* Dynamic programming
* Greedy
* Backtracking

As you can see, we will try to focus on data structures first and then algorithms
since I personally think that data structure are the fundamental for learning more
advanced algorithms as algorithms are implemented with basic data structures. However,
you will find a lot intersections between data structure and algorithms. For example,
in order to solve an array problem, you might have to use the knowledge of binary
search. Therefore, I will try to not include questions that rely on knowledge about
topics that we have not covered yet. However, I will keep a note on my end to make
sure that we re-visit those problems after we cover the topics. After we visit every
topic, all the dots will be connected.

There are some topics that I didn't include in above list because they have less frequencies
though they are equally important as those problems with higher frequencies. For
example: Trie, Segment tree, Ordered map and etc. I will still cover these topics
at the time when I think I am ready.

I will create a folder(category) and also tag for each of the topics. You can either
browse by category, tag or simply search in the search box.
